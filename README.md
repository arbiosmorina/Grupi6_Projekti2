In this project we implemented the base32 encoder and decoder. This implementation can be used in many scenarios, such as information security, authentication and data distribution.
We implemented the project through the Java programming language, this code is open source which people implemented before but we just managed to make changes and make that one work for our needs.
If you want to try this just run our code in the Java editor you use, and everything will work.
